# Prediction-of-Breast-Cancer (Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset)

The repository is a learning exercise to:
Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset.
Evaluate and interpret results and justify interpretation based on observed data set.

Implementation:
Applied 5 machine learning algorithms on the dataset: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear SVC, Random Forest, Adaboost Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour.
Compared the performances of models based on the following evaluation metrics: ROC Curve, Accuracy, and F1_Score and concluded that Random Forest with an accuracy of 97.4% performed better than the other models.
